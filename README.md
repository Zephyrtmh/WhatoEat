# Getting Started with WhatoEat App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About WhatoEat

"What should we eat today?" <br/>
                                        "Hmmm, I'm ok with anything." <br/>
"How about chicken rice?" <br/>
                                        "Oh, I'm not really feeling chicken rice today."<br/>

Ever had a conversation similar to this? Well, WhatoEat aims to solve exactly this! WhatoEat is an all in one app that decides what to eat (heh) based on a set of filters, and then displays a list of shops nearby for the selected food item.
