# Getting Started with WhatoEat App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About WhatoEat

<span style="color: navy">"What should we eat today?"</span> <br/>
"Hmmm, I'm ok with whatever." <br/>
"How about chicken rice?" <br/>
"Oh, I'm not really feeling chicken rice today."<br/>

Ever had a conversation similar to this? Well, WhatoEat aims to solve exactly this! WhatoEat is an all in one app that decides what to eat (heh) based on a set of filters, and then displays a list of shops nearby for the selected food item. 

## Running Application locally

The respository contains the **client** folder (frontend) and **server** folder (backend and database).

To run project locally, follow steps shown below:

1. In the client directory, run `npm start` in the console. This runs the client side app on http://localhost:3000
2. In the server directory, run `node index.js` in the console. This runs the server side app locally and listens to port 5432
3. The app should function as expected.
